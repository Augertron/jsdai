The complete diagram represents all the definitions, relationships and
constraints using either an <a href="#Complete_Entity_Level_Diagram">entity
level</a> or <a href="#Complete_Schema_Level_Diagram">schema level</a>
diagram. <br>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">A
complete schema level diagram for a single schema
consists of:</span> <br>
<ul>
  <li>Each page is titled, with the title starting with the words:
"Complete schema level diagram of ...";</li>
  <li>Each page is numbered in the form Page X of N, where N - total

  <li>The names of all definitions that are either used or referenced
are attached to the relevant relationship line, together with any
renames. If no names are attached to a relationship line, this is
