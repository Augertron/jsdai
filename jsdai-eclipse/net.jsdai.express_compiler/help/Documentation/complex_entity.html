<br>
The express compiler may be given a list of complex entities that have
to be created in addition to the entities defined in express schemas
directly.<br>
Again, a default location for the complex entity directory is defined
for each express project, but it may be customized.<br>
The complex entity directory may contain one or more files with the
lists of required complex entities. These files may have any names<br>
but the extension must be .ce.&nbsp; The contents of all the .ce files
in the directory is used by the express compiler, as if they were
merged into one file.<br>
Multiple files are supported because they may be convenient for users,
and it is possible that in future versions of JSDAI Express Compiler
feature,<br>
some complex list files will be generated automatically if determined
by used JSDAI applications that (more) complex entities are needed.<br>
The data format for defining a needed complex entity in a .ce file is
as follows: [LINK perhaps?]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The file contains a list of complex entity data
types with several leaves.<br>
&nbsp; A separate line is used for each complex entity.<br>
&nbsp; Only the leave-elements are given.<br>
&nbsp; Leaves are separated by + symbols.<br>
&nbsp; Example: entity_1+entity_2+entity_3<br>
&nbsp; For each complex entity, an optional schema name followed by :
may be given at the beginning of the line. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It specifies in which schema the complex
entity is to be placed.<br>
&nbsp; For each leaf entity, an optional schema name prefix followed by
. may be given to resolve ambiguity, i<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n case when entities with
the same name are present in several schemas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: schema_1:schema_2.entity_1+schema_3.entity_2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A line is considered a comment line if it begins
with # character.<br>
<br>
The complex entities that are defined incorrectly are ignored, but the
express compiler gives warnings.<br>
