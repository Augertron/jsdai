Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Mapping of Organization_based_location_representation.organization_for_location. ARM entities Organization_based_location_representation and Organizational_location_identification.

Problem Description: 
1) Mapping of Organization_based_location_representation.organization_for_location is not correct. Target entity in the AIM - organization is written 
as constraint path, but it should be written as target entity.

ALSO select location_representation_item does not have organization in its list used in this mapping path.

2) Organization_based_location_representation and Organizational_location_identification both maps to applied_location_representation_assignment without any additional constraints.
So it is impossible to distinguish them from AIM. Also Organization_based_location_representation points to Organizational_location_identification and mapping 
of this attribute is IDENTICAL. This means that in the AIM those 2 ARM entities must be one AIM entity. 
This attribute is of LIST[0:?] cardinality, but it is impossible to implement another cardinality than 1:1 with IDENTICAL mapping.

Proposal:
1) Instead of current mapping:
					applied_location_representation_assignment
					{applied_location_representation_assignment
					applied_location_representation_assignment.items[i] -&gt;
					location_representation_item =
					organization}
Have the following:
					applied_location_representation_assignment
					applied_location_representation_assignment.items[i] -&gt;
					location_representation_item =
					organization

2) In order to make this ARM model clear it is better to model one ARM entity instead of Organization_based_location_representation and Organizational_location_identification.
