Position_in_organization:
1) Position_group_role.name mapping has wrong sequence in the mapping path:
					applied_position_in_organization_group_assignment <=
					group_assignment =
					project_group_name_item <-
					applied_project_group_name_assignment.items[1] 

group_assignment is not member of the project_group_name_item	select - only applied_position_in_organization_group_assignment is.
Proposal to change the mapping:
					applied_position_in_organization_group_assignment
					project_group_name_item = applied_position_in_organization_group_assignment (* Changed line *)
					project_group_name_item <-                                                  (* Changed line *)
					applied_project_group_name_assignment.items[1]
					applied_project_group_name_assignment <=
					name_assignment
					name_assignment.assigned_name
