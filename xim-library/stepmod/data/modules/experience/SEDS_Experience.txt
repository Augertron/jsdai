Related Issues:

Summary/Abstract/Keywords: Mappings of Experience_type.description, Experience_instance.description and Experience_gained.gained_by.

Problem Description: 
1) Attribute mappings Experience_type.description and Experience_type.name are conflicting.
Experience_type.description is mapped to experience_type.name. But Experience_type.name is mapped to experience_type.name as well.
experience_type in the AIM has "spare" attribute description, which clearly should be used here.

2) Mapping of Experience_instance.description is mixed up. It is written as to be mapped to experience.name in declaration part of the mapping.
While constraint part map it to experience.description. It has to be consistent.

3) Mapping of Experience_gained.gained_by is wrong.
Mapping of Experience_gained.gained_by starts with applied_experience_type_assignment, 
but entity Experience_gained is mapped to applied_experience_assignment

Proposed Solution (Optional):
1) Map Experience_type.description to experience_type.description.

2) Map Experience_instance.description to experience.description in both places.

3) Fix mapping of Experience_gained.gained_by:
applied_experience_assignment
applied_experience_assignment.items[1] ->
experience_item = experience_type
experience_type <-
experience_type_assignment.assigned_experience_type
experience_type_assignment =>
applied_experience_type_assignment
