Summary/Abstract/Keywords: ARM and MIM are not in sync for Surface_related_curve_appearance.

Problem Description: 

Surface_related_curve_appearance mapps to select surface_style_element_select.
But ARM entity Surface_related_curve_appearance has only 6 subtypes, which are not fully matching 7 alternatives in the select.
So formaly there is a contradiction - some options (surface_style_fill_area and surface_style_rendering) are satisfying the mapping of 
Surface_related_curve_appearance, but can't really be supported as they are not reflected in the ARM and they can't satisfy attribute mappings for 
Surface_related_curve_appearance.style.

Also ARM subtype Surface_colour is questionable, because it mapps to surface_style_usage, which is not member of AIM select surface_style_element_select.

Conditions Under Which the Issue Was Discovered: Validation with LKSoft mapping tool.

Proposed Solution (Optional):
Map Surface_related_curve_appearance to only those AIM alternatives which are really supported:
		(surface_style_boundary)
		(surface_style_silhouette)
		(surface_style_segmentation_curve)
		(surface_style_control_grid)
		(surface_style_parameter_line)
