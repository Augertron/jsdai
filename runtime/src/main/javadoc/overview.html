JSDAI is an implementation of the <b><i>Standard Data Access Interface
</i></b>(SDAI,
ISO 10303-22) and its specialization <b><i>Java programming language
    binding
    to the SDAI with Internet/Intranet extensions</i></b> (ISO/TS
10303-27).
The SDAI standard defines an abstract Application Programming Interface
(API) on how to work with STEP data. This is the reference
documentation
of the JSDAI implementation of SDAI for Java together with its
extensions
beyond the SDAI standard such as <i>EXPRESS short form support</i> and
<i>mapping operations</i>. Introduction to JSDAI through examples is
provided
<a href="jsdai_introduction/toc.html">here</a>.
<p>STEP, an acronym for <i>STandard for the Exchange of Product data</i>,
    is a family of standard which starts with ISO 10303. The word <i>Exchange</i>
    is misleading, because SDAI and especially JSDAI is a framework for
    integrated
    data sharing. It allows new CAx and PDM applications to work
    simultaneously
    on shared data, locally or over a network.
</p>
<p>A main part of STEP is the EXPRESS modeling language (ISO 10303-11)
    which is the fundament of SDAI. A basic understanding of EXPRESS is an
    essential requirement for any JSDAI application developer. However, a
    detailed
    understanding of EXPRESS is not required, because JSDAI guides the user
    and takes care of all the details of EXPRESS.
</p>
<p>EXPRESS defines <b>entities</b> which have <b>attributes</b> of
    particular
    <b>types</b>.
    An entity is similar to a Java class or interface. Instances (objects)
    of entities can be created and exported into a <b>STEP-file</b>,
    according
    to the format specification <i>Clear Text Encoding of the Exchange
        Structure</i>
    (ISO 10303-21). Files, based on this standard, are also called
    <b>physical
        files</b> or <b>part21 files</b>. Entity instances can be interchanged
    by part21 files or shared within applications through the SDAI.
</p>
<p>Arbitrary EXPRESS <b>schemas</b> are made available for JSDAI
    through
    the <b>Express Compiler</b>.&nbsp; This tool generates the dictionary
    information
    of the compiled schemas for <b>late binding access</b> and,
    optionally,
    Java classes and interfaces for <b>early binding access</b>. The
    methods
    for late binding access are mainly located in <tt>EEntity</tt>
    and <tt>Aggregate</tt>. These methods work for arbitrary entity types
    and
    attributes, but to use these methods an application needs to operate in
    parallel on entity instances of the dictionary schema and of the
    application
    schema. Because of this, most applications will use early binding
    access.
    Late binding access is only recommended for application which needs to
    operate on schemas which are not necessarily known during compile time.
</p>
<p>For early binding access, every EXPRESS entity "xxx" is represented
    by a Java interface "EXxx", a Java class "CXxx" and an additional Java
    class "AXxx" for aggregates to contain instances of this entity. The
    differentiation
    between EXxx and CXxx is essential, because only the Java interfaces
    support
    multiple inheritance, but not the Java classes. Therefore, applications
    operate on entity instances mainly with the EXxx types and only for
    some
    specific methods (for example, <tt>usedin</tt> and <tt>createEntityInstance</tt>)
    the CXxx classes are needed. Also, for other EXPRESS elements like
    defined
    types and enumerations some specific Java classes and interfaces are
    generated.
    Together with the "AXxx" classes they support <b>strict typing </b>which
    results in clear and easy to read application program. Another benefit
    from the strict typing is that many potential errors of an JSDAI
    application
    can already be detected during compile time. The exact definition how
    Java
    classes, interfaces and methods to generate from EXPRESS is given in
    ISO/TS
    10303-27. The users of JSDAI don't need to understand this conversion
    (from
    EXPRESS to Java) in detail. They can simply check the result of this
    conversion
    in this HTML documentation. The HTML documentation generated by <i>javadoc</i>
    and <i>ExpressDoc</i> gives a detailed information of the result.
</p>
<p>EXPRESS schemas exist in the so called <i>long form</i> and <i>short
    form</i>. Long form schemas are "stand-alone", they do not rely on
    definitions
    in other schemas. Short form schemas, however, have USE FROM and
    REFERENCE
    FROM statements to interface elements from other schemas. STEP
    Application
    Protocols define a short form and an equivalent long form schema.
    Traditionally,
    only the long form schemas are used in part21 exchange files. JSDAI
    supports
    both, short and long forms, but cannot hold both forms in parallel for
    the same schema. We recommend to use the short form schemas. The
    default
    JSDAI-Library is fully based on the EXPRESS short forms.
</p>
<p>More detailed description of how EXPRESS schemas are mapped to Java
    classes is provided <a href="express_to_java/index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>STEP Application Protocols consist of the ARM (Application Reference
    Model), the AIM (Application Integrated Model) and a mapping between
    them.
    In cases where the AIM *and* the ARM is given in EXPRESS the mapping
    between
    them can be converted into a population of the <i>SDAI_mapping_schema</i>
    by the <b>MappingCompiler</b>. The mapping operations on EEntity
    and SdaiModel take advantage of the mapping data, so that JSDAI
    applications
    can operate on ARM concepts while working with AIM instances.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The <i>JSDAI Runtime Environment</i> in <b>jsdai_runtime.jar</b>
    contains these packages :
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b><tt>jsdai.lang</tt></b> containing the core classes and
        interfaces with
        SDAI operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><tt>jsdai.dictionary</tt>,</b> containing Java interfaces and
        classes
        representing meta dictionary data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><tt>jsdai.mapping</tt></b>, containing Java interfaces and
        classes to
        hold mapping data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <tt><b>jsdai.util</b>,</tt> with the kernel applications SdaiTerm
        and SdaiEdit
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><tt>jsdai.beans</tt></b>, containing basis JSDAI related beans
        which
        can be reused by applications
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><tt>jsdai.query </tt></b>for Express based query support on
        local repositories<b><tt><br>
    </tt></b></li>
    <li><b><tt>jsdai.xml </tt></b>for any kind of XML import and export
        such as part28
    </li>
    <li><b><tt>com.lksoft.util</tt></b> for other non jsdai related
        utility classes<br>
    </li>
</ul>
The <i>JSDAI Library</i> in <b>jsdai_library.jar </b>is
automatically generated by the <i>JSDAI ExpressCompiler</i>.
It contains:
<ul>
    <li>
        a number of packages in the form <b><tt>jsdai.SXxx</tt></b>,
        containing
        dictionary data and early binding Java interfaces and classes for
        EXPRESS
        schema xxx. To keep the library in a handy size no early binding
        interface
        and classes are provided for ARM schemas.
    </li>
</ul>
The optional package <span style="font-weight: bold;">jsdai_lib_mapping.jar</span>
including the ARM-AIM mapping information and classes is partly
generated by the <i>JSDAI MappingCompiler</i>. It includes<br>
<ul>
    <li>a number of packages in the form <b><tt>jsdai.MXxx</tt></b>,
        containing
        mapping data for an STEP Application Protocol xxx. Some explanations
        and
        real world example are provided <a
                href="file:///C:/LKSoft/cvs/modules/core/source/jsdai/info/jsdai/lang/MGenericEntries.html">here</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
All packages starting with <tt>jsdaix</tt><span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>contain code for specific
STEP schemas. Their usage requires the default <i>JSDAI Library</i> <tt>jsdai_library.jar</tt>
or equivalent. They are not documented here, e.g.:<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b><tt>jsdaix.view3d</tt></b> contains a viewer for A-BREP, F-BREP,
        Wireframe and other shape_representations
        by using the Java3D<sup>TM</sup>-API.
    </li>
</ul>
This documentation is generated by using various tools, depending on
the
package:
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>jsdai.lang </i>and the general frame structure is created with <b>javadoc</b>,
        based on the standard doclet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>jsdai.dictionary</i>, <i>jsdai.mapping</i> and all <i>jsdai.SXxx</i>
        are created with <b>ExpressDoc</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Documents on <i>jsdai.MXxx</i> are created with <b>MappingDoc </b>(the
        details of the mapping such as the reference path is not included
        because of the ISO copyright).
    </li>
</ul>
