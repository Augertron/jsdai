/**
 * The interface Aggregate represents a collection of arbitrary EXPRESS data types,
 * called members of this aggregate.
 * Due to a special nature of the EXPRESS data types, especially the select data type,
 * it is not possible to use java.util.Collection or Java arrays for this purpose.
 * The interface Aggregate contains the access methods which are common for all
 * aggregate classes and also the late binding member access methods for the
 * basic data types (double, integer, enumeration, String, Binary), entity instances,
 * nested aggregates, defined data types or a selection thereof. <br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * The aggregates created with the <code>new</code> operator are non-persistent;
 * that is, they are not stored within a repository.
 * The aggregates used as values of EXPRESS ENTITY attributes are persistent.
 * They cannot be created with the <code>new</code> operator.
 * Applications need to use special create operations for this.
 * This is also the case for nested aggregates.<br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * The aggregates must be of one of the following EXPRESS types: SET, BAG, LIST or ARRAY.
 * The type of an aggregate is determined when an <code>Aggregate</code> is created.
 * When creating a non-persistent aggregate with the <code>new</code> operator, the type
 * always is LIST. Otherwise, the type of the <code>Aggregate</code> is determined
 * by its usage as an ENTITY attribute or within a nested aggregate. The actual type
 * of an <code>Aggregate</code> can be retrieved with getAggregationType method
 * which returns the dictionary description of every aggregate (or null if method
 * is applied to non-persistent list).<br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * Each of types SET, BAG and LIST has a lower bound and, optionally, an upper bound.
 * Indexing of members in aggregates of type SET, BAG and LIST starts from 1.
 * Aggregates of type ARRAY always have a lower index and an upper index.
 * The actual number of members in an aggregate can be retrieved with
 * getMemberCount method.<br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * The members of aggregates can be accessed either by an integer index
 * or by a <a href="SdaiIterator.html">SdaiIterator</a> object.
 * An <code>SdaiIterator</code> is created for a specific <code>Aggregate</code> with createIterator method. An
 * <code>SdaiIterator</code> can be attached to
 * another aggregate using method attachIterator.<br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * The aggregates are either ordered collections(LIST, ARRAY) or unordered ones(BAG, SET).
 * While some operations in <code>Aggregate</code> are available for any type, others
 * are available only for specific types. The table given below indicates which operation is
 * available for which EXPRESS aggregation type. The access column (acc) indicates whether
 * the operation is defined on members specified by an index (i), specified by an <code>SdaiIterator</code> (I) or for no specific
 * member(-).
 * Some of the operations are available as methods on <code>SdaiIterator</code>.<br>
