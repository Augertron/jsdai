In implementation phase:

* Template support (queries on ARM)
	Add	isValueResult to QueryVal (done)
	Add a separate method to process child constraint which could be invoked from QueryLibVal (done)
	Fix child constraint processing for MappingVal (done)
	Create methods Context.assign and Context.isNarrowedBy (done)
	Create executeInv methods for Fwd, Inv, Union, And, Or, and Intersect classes and subclasses (done)
	Replace single linked list of Constraint to double list (done)
	Remote: implement RemoteContext.assign and isNarrowedBy
	Remote: implement executeInv for Fwd and Inv

* Remote queries.
  Working but still limited

* Conversion of mapping data to xml queries

* Preloaded query support

* Cover mapping operation functionality. First step would be to allow results 
  of any type not only AEntity (done)

Medium priority:

* Full aggregate support (real handling of attr and attr-size attributes)

* Parameter support

* Queries for local SdaiRepository, SchemaInstance, and Aggregate (AEntity only).
  Implementation should be mainly on ASdaiModel

* Write specification document from comments in DTD and 
  javadoc documentation in query classes and methods.
  Specification should be an HTML file(s) and javadoc would reference it.

Lower priority:

* Other comparison operations (not only eq and neq), regular expressions (done)

* Domain support (probably only for remote repositories). Maybe it's even not needed.

Implemented:

* Move newQuery method to session. Then execute would get a domain to 
  execute the query on (SdaiModel, SchemaInstance, SdaiRepository, etc.)

* Knowledge about other types not only string in val
