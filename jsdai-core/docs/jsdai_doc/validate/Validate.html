<h1>Validation of STEP files</h1>
<P>
<code>Validate</code> is an application program used to validate exchange structures, that is, files 
prepared according to 'ISO 10303-21: Implementation methods: Clear text encoding of the exchange structure'.
After importing the submitted exchange structure to a temporary repository, validation is performed in two stages:
<br>- validation of all entity instances contained in all models of the repository;
<br>- validation of all global and uniqueness rules for all schema instances of the repository.
<br>In the first stage for each entity instance the following operations are performed:
<br>- validate required explicit attributes assigned;
<br>- validate inverse attributes;
<br>- validate explicit attributes references;
<br>- validate aggregates size;
<br>- validate aggregates uniqueness;
<br>- validate array not optional;
<br>- validate where rule.
<br>In the second stage the following two operations on schema instances are performed:
<br>- validate global rule;
<br>- validate uniqueness rule.
<P>
<code>Validate</code> belongs to <code>jsdai.util</code> package and for a given exchange structure with the name, say, 
'abc.stp' could be executed by applying a command like this:
<P><pre>    java -Djava.ext.dirs=<em>C:/path/to/jsdai/ext/dir</em> jsdai.util.Validate abc.stp -stdout Valid.log</pre>
Here 'Valid.log' is (an arbitrary) name of a log file produced by the program. 
<br><strong>NOTE:</strong> similarly as other JSDAI-based applications, <code>Validate</code> also requires configuration file 
<code>jsdai.properties</code> to be in its disposition.
<br>The log file includes the following information:
<br>- the name of the exchange structure and the name of the repository to which this structure is imported;
<br>- for each model the total number of instances and a list of instances not conforming to the validation; 
  for each such instance also a more specific information (like violated rules or atributes with 
  mandatory values not set) is displayed; in the case when a where rule is violated its parent item 
  (either partial entity data type or defined type) is indicated;
<br>- for each model the number of instances not conforming to the validation;
<br>- for each schema instance the total number of global rules and a list of global rules which are not 
  satisfied by the population associated with this schema instance; for each such global rule 
  violated where rules are given;
<br>- for each schema instance the number of global rules for which validation has failed (<code>false</code> was 
  returned);
<br>- for each schema instance a list of violated uniqueness rules (if any); for each such rule entity instances 
  not conforming to the validation are displayed;
<br>- for each schema instance the number of violated uniqueness rules.
<P>
You should see in the log file something similar to:
