<h1>SdaiEdit</h1>
SdaiEdit is a tool to analyse and modify STEP data and other EXPRESS defined
data.
<ul>
  
  <li>STEP, <i>STandard for the Exchchange of Product modul data</i>, isan
standard of the International Standard Organization (ISO 10303) consisting
of several parts.</li>
  
  <li>EXPRESS is the data modelling language within STEP (ISO 10303-11)</li>
  
  <li>SdaiEdit is directly based on the JSDAI<sup>TM</sup> implementation
of the Standard Data Access Interface (SDAI, ISO 10303-22). SDAI is the universal
Application Programming Interface to work on any kind of data based on an
EXPRESS schema.</li>
  
  <li>Data is mainly exchanged through STEP-Files&nbsp; (ISO 10303-21). JSDAI
is able to read and write any kind of STEP-File. STEP-Files are also called
part21-files or physical files and have usually the extension *.p21, *.stp
or an extension according to the Application Protocoall they are using (e.g.
*.203 for AP203 or *.210 for AP210). </li>
  
  <li>SdaiEdit can handle data in local repositories or on remote JSDAI-Servers
or databases through the JSDAI-SQL-Bridge.<br>
  </li>
  
  <li>SdaiEdit and its underlying JSDAI application is fully based on the
Java<sup>TM</sup> programming language and is therefor platform neutral.</li>
  
  <li>In addition to the standard SDAI functionality SdaiEdit offers higher
level operations through the Mapping pages. STEP APs consists of a so called
Application Reference Model (ARM), the Application Integrated Model (AIM)
and a mapping specification between the ARM and the AIM. The ARM definesthe
application specific view while the AIM is a generic model which supportintegration
of various STEP APs and extensions. The Mapping pages allowsto view AIM-data
with ARM-concepts. Currently AP210, AP212, and AP214 issupported in this
way.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
SdaiEdit is a tool for STEP experts, who have a detailed understanding of
the EXPRESS modelling language. A special understanding of the SDAI concepts
is not needed. The main SDAI concepts are repository, model, schema_instance
.<br>
 
<h2>Installation</h2>
SdaiEdit is delivered as an automatic installation package. E.g. the version
2.4.0 of JSDAI, SdaiEdit and StepBook is installed as follows:<br>
<ul>
  
  <li>For Windows systems run<br>
    
    <blockquote> jsdai240.exe</blockquote>
    </li>
    
    <li>On&nbsp; Unix systems run<br>
      
      <blockquote>./jsdai240.bin</blockquote>
      </li>
      
      <li>For universal installation on Java-enabled platforms run<br>
        
        <blockquote>java -cp jsdai240.jar install</blockquote>
        </li>
      
      </ul>
SdaiEdit requires, that the JavaTM 2 Platform is already installed. During
the installation process take care to select the right Jave Virtual machine
(JVM). Do not select a JVM 1.1.x. A JVM 1.2.x, 1.3.x or higher is requrired.<br>
