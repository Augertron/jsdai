For all pages a common toolbar is given. At the beginning it has <i>forward</i>
and <i>backward</i> buttons with browsing capability. Both have sub menu
where you can selectpreviously visited pages. The <i>new</i> button creates
new SdaiEdit application whichwill share some general data (session) between
one or more SdaiEdit applications and willallow you to work on them in parallel.
The <i>go</i> button proceeds to the page of selected item (as double click
does). The screen can be refreshedto display the actual data with <i>refresh</i>
 button. <i>Copy all</i> button copies all contents ofpage data as a textual
representation to the system clipboard. The actual <i>location</i>of the
displayed page (repository/model/extent/instance) is also given in the common
toolbar.<br>

on a list or table you can press <b>ctrl+f</b>&nbsp; and, after you have
entered a preferred textand pressed <i>OK</i>&nbsp; you will jump to the
