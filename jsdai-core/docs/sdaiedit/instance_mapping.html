<h1>Instance Mapping page</h1>

and press 'Change' button. <br>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
After that all attributes grouped by ARM entity data types are listed. ARM
entitydata types order are the same as inheritance. From top to bottom. For

instance thereis four fields in one line. First one is the name of attribute,
no operationson this field available. Second one is the type of attribute.

separated with split, so you can enlarge attributevalue view. With plus button
you can set value from sdai clipboard for entitytype and with minus button
